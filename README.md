# champagne's-glLab

A small personal lab for experimenting with modern OpenGL in C++.  
This project is part of my ongoing effort to learn more about real-time rendering, graphics pipelines, and shader programming from the ground up.

##  What is this?

`champagne's-glLab` is a collection of small OpenGL programs and rendering experiments I've built while learning graphics programming. The goal is to understand how things work under the hood — no engines, no abstraction layers — just raw OpenGL, C++, and curiosity.

So far, it covers things like:

- Getting OpenGL running with GLFW and GLAD
- Writing shaders and sending data to the GPU
- Loading textures and working with fragment color
- Playing with geometry and transformations
- (Eventually) implementing a camera system and lighting

It’s still a work in progress — more features and cleanup will be added as I go.

##  Built With

- **C++17**
- **OpenGL 3.3+**
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) – for window/context/input
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) – OpenGL loader
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) – for loading textures
- **Visual Studio 2022** – my main IDE (but cross-platform friendly)
